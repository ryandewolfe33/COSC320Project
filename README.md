# COSC320Project

## Dataset.
Include the details of the dataset.
## Implementation. 
Explain how you implemented the algorithm and tested it. All the subtle details should  be  included.  This  is  just  an  explanation  and  you  do  not  need  to  copy  paste  your implementation here. It can be as short as one paragraph. Include links if required.
## Results. 
Include the plots and the interpretation of the plots as input grows. Compare it to the big O function of the running time. For example, if your algorithm runs in , show the graph for 𝑂(𝑛2)the function  in  same  plot  as  well.  Explain  if  this  is  what  you  expected,  and  how  the 𝑛2implementation of your algorithm might have affected the constant values. How the choice of data structure might have affected this result?
## Unexpected Cases/Difficulties. 
If you encountered any issues for design and implementation of your work, include it here. Also, mention the solutions you have considered to alleviate the issue. 
## Task Separation and Responsibilities. 
Who did what for this milestone? Explicitly mention the name of group members and their responsibilities.
