## Implementation. 
Creating the graph. We have updated the pruning on the dataset to only retrive reasonable paths. The begining of the program asks for a souce and destination airports, as well as the date you would like to leave on and the date which you must arrive by. When a flightlist for each airport, it only contains flights in the window defined by the user. We have also updated the weights of the flights, and the algorithm returns the path with the lowest sum of minutes and dollars. Minutes is calculated from the minute you step on the first plane to the minute you step off the last plane at your destination. Currently, each minutes is worth 1$ but this could be updated in a real-world scenario. Now that the dataset has been pruned, we construct the graph the same as we did in milestone 3.
